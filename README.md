# Deep-Learning-Assignment1

This project implements fundamental deep learning models from scratch using Python and NumPy, including:

- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for handwritten digit classification
- Autoencoder for image reconstruction and outlier detection
- Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for feature learning

## Dataset
MNIST handwritten digit dataset (28x28 grayscale images).

## Requirements
Python 3.x  
NumPy  
Matplotlib  
Scikit-learn  

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook
   - Open the uploaded `.ipynb` file

3. Run all cells sequentially:
   Kernel → Restart & Run All

## Output Includes

- Classification accuracy (~92%)
- Training loss curves
- Autoencoder reconstruction images
- RBM filter visualizations
